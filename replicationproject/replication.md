## Replication project choice ##
Guitar

### Related project 1 ###
Banana Keyboard

https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/banana-keyboard

![Image](banana-keyboard-0.png)

This project is related to mine because it had similar ideas to mine. It also involved holding down buttons to make sounds, and it is also a musical instrument project. 

### Related project 2 ###
Hack Your Headphones

https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/hack-your-headphones

![Image](hack-your-headphones-0.png)

This project is related to mine because this project involved headphones and music, just like this project did as well. 

### Related project 3 ###
Milk Carton Robot

https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/milk-carton-robot

![Image](make.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it is also taking some cardboard, and using art, making a fun toy/interactive machine out of it. 

### Related project 4 ###
Reaction Time

https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/reaction-time

![Image](0.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it is also involving a reaction to you pressing against the actual project. 

### Related project 5 ###
Rock Paper Scissors

https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/rock-paper-scissors

![Image](hand.jpg)

This project is related to mine because this is interactive as well and it also reacts to how the user uses the project.

### Related project 6 ###
Magic Button Trick

https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/magic-button-trick

![Image](0-2.jpg)

This project is related to mine because you have to press a button to make the rabbit appear out of the hat. Mine had a similar approach, whcih was that if you pressed the buttons, it would play different sounds.

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*What I thought before: I didn't know what this reading would be about. I couldn't think of what it would be about at all.*

*What I learned: This reading made me realise that we don't think about how doors are really design. Sure, we get annoyed when we push a pull door, but we don't actually think about why doors were designed like that.*

*What I would like to know more about: Why would people think it was an idea to design anything so confusing?.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: This relates to my project because they are both considered 'interactive' and I like how both the reading and my project are respnding to how people react to them.*

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before: I thought that this reading was going to focus on a specific micro-interactive machine, such as a mini-robot for example. 

*What I learned: I learned what a micro-interaction was, and how many things are actually micro-interactive.*

*What I would like to know more about: Are there many more micro-interactions out there that we don't know about?*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: This relates to my project because a micro-interaction are contained product moments that revolve around a single use caseâ€”they have one main task. My project has one main task too - press the buttons and sound will come out.*

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before: I thought this reading was going to be about many different interactive objects there are in the world.*

*What I learned: I learned that there are many things that are still yet to be designed. It may seem like a lot of techologies and interactive objects have been designed already, but it's only just the beginning, and who knows what technologies they'll have in the future.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

*Include screenshots of the code you have used.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*

### Reflection ###

*Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.*


*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*


*What ideas have you read, heard, or seen that informed your thinking on this project? (Provide references.)*


*What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used?*
