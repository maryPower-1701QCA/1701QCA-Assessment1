This is a version of the microbit guitar project that I made. Instead of doing a trumpet, I made a trumpet out of cardboard and paint. I chose the trumpet because I had been playing trumpet for 8 years at school, so I am very familiar with it. 

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how to take a project that already existed and made something new out of it. It helped me to express my creativity, and it also helped me improve more with microbit. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as teaching kids the fun and idea of learning how to play trumpet, or music in general. It can also help kids understand all about coding and it could get them interested in that too.
